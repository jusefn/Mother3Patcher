# Mother3Patcher
A GUI Mother 3 Fan Translation patcher for Windows and macOS. Inspired by Tomato and JeffMan's Mother 3 Fan Translation Patcher


## Information
As of right now, only the WPF design for the application has been completed, the program can't do anything yet as of right now.

## Why?
The Mac Mother 3 patcher no longer works on newer macOS versions and I decided to write a new patcher that is compactible with newer macOS versions and runs on a newer version of .NET Core so it no longer requires installing .NET Framework as a Windows feature.


This project is not affiliated with Nintendo, 1-UP Studio, HAL Laboratories, Shigesato Itoi or the Mother 3 Fan Translation Project.
